###Elasticsearch Osgified

Application that will embed the fulltextsearch engine [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch) in a OSGI container.

Currently I'm using Equinox with [Pax-Runner](https://github.com/ops4j/org.ops4j.pax.runner)

To run the tests execute `mvn clean install`
